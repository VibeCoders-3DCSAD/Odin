email verification. Login restricts access until email verification is complete.

- Forgot password: email
- Password validation and matching-password validation during password recovery
- Email placeholder: `you@example.com`
- Password placeholder: `Enter your password`
- Forgot-password email placeholder: `Enter your registered email`
