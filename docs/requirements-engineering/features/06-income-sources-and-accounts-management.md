## 6. Income Sources and Accounts Management

### 6.1 Account Management

- View total money across all accounts
- View the list of financial accounts
- Add a financial account
- After successfully creating a savings account, show a modal: "Congratulations
  on your new savings account!" and "Do you want to add a goal?"
- Offer "Yes" to open Add Savings Goal with the new account preselected, or
  "Maybe next time" to return to Accounts. Do not show this invitation for
  account edits, other account kinds, cancelled forms, or failed saves.
- View financial account details
- Edit a financial account
- Archive a financial account with confirmation while preserving its transaction history.
- View archived financial accounts separately from accounts currently in use.
- Require archiving before a financial account can be deleted.
- Delete an archived financial account with separate confirmation while preserving
  its transaction history.

### 6.2 Account Form

- Account name
- Account type choices: Cash / Bank / E-Wallet / Credit Card / Other. Savings is excluded from the selector. Existing savings accounts retain their stored type and remain editable.
- Savings uses one form without a Personal Savings, HYSA, Goal Savings, or Time Deposit subtype selector. Display these accounts as Savings; preserve existing stored account details and edit them in the same account action sheet.
- Savings interest configuration belongs entirely under Advanced Options. Offer Daily Balance/ADB and Simple/Compound/None with fixed nominal annual rates only. Exclude tiered and conditional controls. None saves a zero rate and disables interest settings while preserving history.
- Preserve legacy savings terms and schedules when editing; do not require minimum balance.
- Balance
- Institution name
- Opening date
- Configure planned contributions, their frequency, and contribution dates in
  Savings Goals. Omit these controls from financial-account forms, including
  HYSA forms. Preserve schedules already saved on older accounts when editing.
- Credit limit, when applicable
- Payment deadline, for credit card accounts
- Cut-off day of the month (1-31), for credit card accounts
- Alert threshold percentage of credit limit, for credit card accounts

  in chronological order; for Every week, select a weekday.
- Use the last day of the month when a payday exceeds that month's length.
- Keep twice-monthly paydays distinct even in February.
- Apply saved schedule changes from the current date without generating missed
  income from earlier paydays.
- Stop future generation when the income source is archived or deleted and preserve

### Fixed savings interest form

- All interest fields live under Advanced Options, including the rate. Rates are nominal annual percentages, not APY; the label remains Interest Rate.
- Defaults: Daily Balance, Compound upon crediting, daily calculation, monthly credit periods, period-end posting, today as start, calendar-month ADB, Actual/365, withholding enabled at 20%, and manual entry of actual bank interest. Rates themselves have no assumed value.
- Offer custom credit intervals in days, configurable posting day/date, an independent ADB period, optional minimum qualifying and maximum interest-bearing balances, and Actual/366 or Actual/Actual.
- Backdating a new start requires a starting balance. None disables all interest controls, saves zero interest and preserves rate history and historical transactions.
- Store effective-dated rate changes; existing saved rate entries are read-only in the form. Validate dates, tax percentages, intervals, bounds, increasing rate-history dates and safe integer centavos.
- Simple interest requires independent principal accounting. The selected convention reduces deposited principal before credited interest on withdrawals. Compound behavior applies only upon crediting net interest; no invisible daily compounding.
- Automated interest is excluded. Do not offer automatic projection or credit controls. Enter actual bank interest manually as income. Disable legacy cron/posting paths without changing historical transactions or balances. The stored compatibility flag `autoProject` always normalizes to false.
- Visibility preference covers current balance, gross accrual, estimated tax, net interest, applicable rate, next credit date and calculation breakdown.
- **Implementation boundary:** the current change saves and validates the revised form configuration. These bank terms do not generate transactions or balance changes. Automated credit generation has been removed; migration 20261116000009 also disables the legacy worker.
