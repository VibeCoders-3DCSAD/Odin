# Odin Project Agents Guide

## Priority: Coding Standards

This section is the highest-priority project rule set. When there is any ambiguity in implementation, structure, naming, or dependency usage, follow these standards first.

Detailed repository standards live in [REPOSITORY-STANDARDS.md](docs/standards/REPOSITORY-STANDARDS.md). That file is the canonical location for enforceable coding standards and review rules.

### Standards Bootstrap

- Before making code or documentation changes in a consuming repository, verify that `AGENTS.md` and `docs/standards/REPOSITORY-STANDARDS.md` exist in that repository.
- If the shared standards are missing, clone the standards repository as a sibling of `odin` and `odin-ml`:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/VibeCoders-3DCSAD/odin-standards.git ../odin-standards
  ```
- After cloning, run the sync script from the consuming repository root:
  ```bash
  ../odin-standards/scripts/sync-standards.sh
  ```
- On Windows PowerShell, run:
  ```powershell
  ..\odin-standards\scripts\sync-standards.ps1
  ```
- On Windows Command Prompt, run:
  ```bat
  ..\odin-standards\scripts\sync-standards.cmd
  ```
- Do not continue with implementation work until the local standards files are present and readable.

### Enforcement

- Treat this file as the project-wide source of truth for code organization and baseline engineering rules.
- Do not introduce new patterns, dependencies, or folder layouts that conflict with this file.
- Prefer extending an existing convention over creating a parallel convention.
- Keep implementations consistent across `odin` and `odin-ml` where the same architectural concern exists.
- If a new rule is needed, add it here before spreading the new pattern across the codebase.

### Required Standards

- Put code in the correct repository and directory based on responsibility.
- Keep frontend concerns in `odin/apps/app/`.
- Keep Node and Express backend concerns in `odin/apps/api/`.
- Keep shared TypeScript code in `odin/packages/`.
- Keep ML and FastAPI service concerns in `odin-ml/app/`.
- Keep tests near the repo they validate and use the approved testing stack for that repo.
- Install Node dependencies with `pnpm` only.
- Install Python dependencies in `odin-ml` using a virtual environment only.
- Respect the pinned runtime versions defined by `.nvmrc`, `.node-version`, `packageManager`, and `.python-version`.

### Domain and Data Scope Rules

- Odin is a single-user-account application, not a multi-tenant application.
- Model the system as `1 user = 1 account`.
- Do not introduce tenant, organization, workspace, or company-scoped architecture unless project requirements explicitly change.
- Even without multi-tenancy, all user-owned data must still be scoped to the authenticated user.
- Queries, mutations, derived data, and UI state that represent persisted user data must always resolve within the current authenticated user's boundary.
- Translate any multi-tenant review rule from prior experience into `user_id` ownership rules for this project.
- Do not fetch, update, or delete user-owned records without explicit user scoping.
- Validate foreign keys and related record references against the authenticated user's ownership boundary before use.
- Read paths need ownership checks too, not only write paths.

### Input, Database, and Sanitization Rules

- Any data that reaches the database must be validated, cleaned, and sanitized thoroughly.
- Treat dropdown values, form fields, query params, route params, and request bodies as untrusted input.
- Validate inputs before persistence and before using them in queries, filters, or downstream processing.
- Normalize values where appropriate so equivalent inputs do not create inconsistent stored data.
- Do not trust client-side validation as sufficient protection; enforce validation and sanitization at the backend boundary as well.
- Prefer explicit schemas and narrow accepted values over permissive input handling.
- Whitelist constrained values such as sort order, filter keys, and dropdown-backed options.
- Keep database reads for dropdowns and selector lists bounded and filtered to the current user's accessible records.

### Dependency Discipline

- Do not add a new dependency when an existing project dependency already solves the problem adequately.
- Prefer shared utilities over duplicating logic across app, API, and ML service layers.
- Add frontend-only dependencies to `odin/apps/app`.
- Add backend-only Node dependencies to `odin/apps/api`.
- Add Python and ML dependencies only to `odin-ml`.
- Keep shared contracts, schemas, and reusable TypeScript utilities in `odin/packages`.

### Structural Discipline

- Organize by responsibility, not by arbitrary preference.
- Separate transport, business logic, and shared utilities.
- Avoid dumping unrelated files into repo roots.
- Create new top-level directories only when they represent a durable architectural boundary.
- Use clear, stable naming for files and folders.

### Function Design Rules

- Functions should do one thing only.
- If a function is growing in scope, split it before it becomes a maintenance problem.
- If a function can be cleanly decomposed into smaller responsibilities, decompose it.
- Prefer small composable functions over large multi-purpose functions.

### No God Classes or God Components

- Do not create god classes, god services, or god components.
- Split files that accumulate unrelated responsibilities.
- Keep components focused on presentation and local interaction concerns.
- Move data loading, orchestration, transformation, and domain logic out of oversized components.
- If a component or class becomes the default place for unrelated code, break it apart.

### DRY Rules

- Do not repeat logic that can be shared safely.
- Extract repeated logic into a reusable function, helper, module, or shared package at the correct boundary.
- Do not duplicate validation, transformation, or query-building logic across files.
- Prefer a single maintained source of truth over copied parallel implementations.

### Helper Placement Rules

- If a helper is reused across multiple files in the same area, move it into a dedicated helper file.
- Shared helpers should not stay embedded inside unrelated feature files once reuse is established.
- Place shared helpers in a `helpers/` directory within the nearest appropriate module boundary.
- Keep helper placement local first, and only move helpers higher in the tree when reuse crosses module boundaries.

### Logging Rules

- Do not log sensitive data.
- Never log secrets, access tokens, refresh tokens, passwords, raw credentials, or full authentication payloads.
- Do not log personally sensitive user data unless there is a clear operational need and the value is minimized.
- Prefer structured logs with safe identifiers and diagnostic context over dumping raw objects.
- Redact or omit sensitive fields before writing request, response, or error context to logs.
- Include safe diagnostic context in logs such as `user_id`, record IDs, request IDs, counts, and status values.
- Never return raw exception messages to clients.
- Log full exception objects server-side so stack traces and failure origins are preserved.

### Destructive Action Rules

- Any destructive user action must require explicit confirmation.
- Destructive actions include delete, reset, revoke, overwrite, purge, and irreversible state changes.
- Confirmation UX must clearly state what will change and whether the action can be undone.
- Do not make destructive operations one-tap or one-click by accident.

### Frontend App Standards

- The rules in this section apply to `odin/apps/app/`.

#### Component Architecture Standards

- Keep components small and purpose-specific.
- Separate screen composition, data fetching, state orchestration, and presentational UI when complexity grows.
- Prefer feature-local composition over monolithic screens.
- Extract reusable UI into components and reusable behavior into hooks or helpers.
- Do not bury business logic inside large JSX trees.
- Keep shared domain types in a reusable `types/` location and keep component-specific prop types colocated with the component.
- Do not prop drill past 2 levels; use a store or context when state crosses deeper trees.
- Keep state hooks close to the component or feature that owns them.
- Keep stores and contexts organized consistently and discoverably.

#### Mutation Pending State Rules

- Do not share one mutation pending state across an entire rendered list when actions are item-specific.
- Track pending state per item when multiple rows, cards, or list entries can trigger the same mutation.
- Avoid locking unrelated items in the UI because one item is mutating.
- Item-scoped actions must show item-scoped loading, disabled state, and error handling.

#### Layout and Positioning Rules

- Do not use magic pixel numbers for positioning when layout primitives can express the intent.
- Prefer flexbox, spacing systems, alignment rules, and relative layout over arbitrary offsets.
- If a numeric spacing value is necessary, it should be explainable by the design system or layout requirement.
- Avoid fragile positioning that only works for one screen size or one content length.

#### Auth Hydration Rules

- Guard against auth hydration flashes in the frontend app.
- Do not render authenticated screens or protected content before auth state has been resolved.
- Add explicit loading or hydration guards around auth-dependent UI.
- Prevent brief flashes of unauthenticated or incorrect content during app startup and refresh.
- Treat `undefined` or unresolved auth/data state as different from loaded-empty state.

### Authorization and Service Boundary Rules

- Use `403` for permission denials on authenticated users and reserve `401` for authentication failures.
- Never comment out authorization checks.
- If one endpoint in a controller or route group requires authorization, verify the rest explicitly too, especially write endpoints.
- Services must not reach into auth/session globals directly; pass authenticated user context or `user_id` explicitly as parameters.
- Permission strings must use lowercase `object:action` format consistently.

### Query and Persistence Rules

- Never concatenate user input into raw SQL.
- Whitelist user-controlled sort columns and sort directions explicitly.
- Scope every read and write for user-owned records by `user_id`.
- Verify every request ID that references a user-owned record before reading or writing with it.
- Verify related IDs and pivot-table associations against the current user's ownership boundary before insert or sync.
- Read methods require ownership verification too, not only mutations.
- Never run database queries inside loops when a batch query can be used instead.
- Keep dropdown and selector queries bounded; avoid unbounded reads for UI lists.
- Use transactions for multi-step writes that must succeed or fail together.
- Separate store/create validation from update validation when uniqueness rules differ.
- Match string literal casing to the actual stored database values instead of guessing.
- Check sentinel values such as `0`, empty string, or `null` paths explicitly before ownership guards or lookups.

### External I/O and Reliability Rules

- Set explicit timeouts on all outbound HTTP calls.
- Treat frontend button disabling as UX only, not as a substitute for backend safety guarantees.
- Any future payment or payment-like mechanism must be idempotent at the backend and storage layers.

### Frontend Security and Storage Rules

- Do not store PII in client-side storage keys.
- Use opaque identifiers such as internal IDs or slugs in storage keys instead of emails, names, or phone numbers.

### Testing Rules

- Test real behavior, not assumed behavior.
- Read the source before writing selectors, redirects, or interaction assertions.
- Mock the full call graph a component depends on, not only the obvious first-level requests.
- Mock data must match the real runtime shape returned by the backend or database layer.
- In Playwright, register specific routes after broad routes and be deliberate about LIFO matching behavior.
- Block non-essential external resources in E2E tests when they interfere with deterministic load behavior.
- Keep test method signatures aligned with the production method signatures they exercise.

### Remediation Rules

- When a security or correctness issue is found in one place, sweep the codebase for the same pattern before considering the fix complete.

### Documentation Discipline

- When structure or dependency rules change, update `AGENTS.md`.
- When coding standards change, update `REPOSITORY-STANDARDS.md`.
- When setup instructions change, update the relevant `README.md`.
- Do not let repository documentation drift behind the actual implementation.

This file is the shared top-level orientation document for the Odin workspace.
In consuming repositories, keep a copy at the repository root and keep shared
standards under `docs/standards/`.

It covers the two repositories in this workspace:

- `odin`: main application monorepo
- `odin-ml`: machine learning microservice

Use this file as the single project-level reference for dependency versions and directory placement rules. Coding standards can be added here incrementally.

Use these files as the source of truth for local runtime selection.

## Git Commit Message Standards

Use this format for commit messages:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <brief message>
```

Required subject format:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <brief message>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

- Use lowercase `type` and `scope` tokens.
- Always include a scope. Do not use unscoped subjects such as `fix: ...`.
- Keep the brief message specific, imperative, and focused on the change.

### Commit Types

- `build`: build system, packaging, or compile pipeline changes
- `chore`: maintenance tasks that do not change functionality
- `ci`: continuous integration, checks, or release automation
- `docs`: documentation-only changes
- `feat`: new features or capabilities
- `fix`: bug fixes or behavior corrections
- `perf`: performance improvements
- `refactor`: structural improvements without changing behavior
- `revert`: reverts of prior commits
- `style`: formatting-only changes with no behavior impact
- `test`: test-only changes

### Commit Scopes

- `api`: API routing, transport, request handling, or API contracts
- `app`: Expo app shell, navigation, or app-level wiring
- `backend`: backend service logic outside narrow API routing
- `ci`: CI configuration, checks, or workflow files

Examples:

```text
feat(frontend): add budget summary screen
fix(database): scope transactions by user id
chore(deps): update supabase cli
docs(standards): document commit message format
```

### Subject Rules

- Keep the subject between 50 and 72 characters when possible.
- Use imperative mood.
- Start the brief message lowercase unless it begins with a proper noun,
  acronym, or code identifier.
- Do not end the subject with a period.

### Body Rules

- Use a blank line between the subject and the body.
- Wrap body lines at 72 characters when practical.
- Explain what changed and why it changed.
- Prefer context and intent over repeating implementation details from the diff.
- Use short paragraphs or short bullets when helpful.

Suggested body order:

1. Current situation
2. Reason for change
3. Action taken
4. Impact or notes

### Footer Rules

- Add footers only when they provide useful metadata.
- Use consistent footer tokens such as `Fixes:`, `Closes:`, `Refs:`, `See also:`, or `BREAKING CHANGE:`.
- Keep footer metadata concise.

### Commit Quality Rule

A valid commit subject should complete this sentence naturally:

```text
If applied, this commit will <your subject line here>
```

## Top-Level Directory Layout

```text
App/
├─ AGENTS.md
├─ odin/
